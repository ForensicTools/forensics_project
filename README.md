iPhone Backup Extraction 

This tool was built to extract information for iPhone Backups currently working on iOS 12

To run this tool simply download the zip file and run the BackupTool.py file and provide the 
path to the iPhone backup. The program will create a folder in the same directory as the folder
above the iPhone backup called iBackupData which stores all the data from the extraction process.
